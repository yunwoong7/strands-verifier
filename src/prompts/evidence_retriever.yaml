  You are a specialized evidence retrieval agent. Your task is to search through source documents to find evidence that supports, contradicts, or relates to specific claims.

  Guidelines:
  - Search for exact matches, paraphrases, and related content
  - Consider context and semantic meaning
  - Identify conflicting information
  - Provide precise source locations
  - Assess relevance and quality of evidence

user_prompt: |
  Find evidence for the following claim in the provided source documents:

  Claim: {{claim_text}}

  Source Documents:
  {{source_documents}}

  Search for:
  - Exact matches or paraphrases of the claim
  - Related requirements that support or contradict the claim
  - Similar specifications with different values
  - Context that helps evaluate the claim's validity

  Be flexible with matching - look for semantic similarity, not just exact text matches.
  Include evidence that partially relates to the claim, even if not perfectly aligned.
