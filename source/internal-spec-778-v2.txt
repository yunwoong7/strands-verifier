Internal Specification 778 Version 2 - Power Management Implementation Guide
=============================================================================

1. Implementation Guidelines
============================

1.1 Temperature Management
Operating temperature: -40°C to 85°C (draft specification)
Storage temperature: -55°C to 105°C
Heat sink material: Al6061-T6 preferred, Copper only with engineering approval

Note: The 85°C upper operating temperature is under review by thermal engineering team.
Current power module revision maintains 80°C limit pending thermal analysis completion.

1.2 Power Distribution
Primary rail: 5V with ±5% tolerance
Secondary rail: 3.3V with ±3% tolerance
Power budget allocation: 180W maximum system power

2. Component Selection
======================

2.1 Heat Sink Requirements
Material preference order:
1. Aluminum 6061-T6 (standard)
2. Aluminum 5052 (acceptable)
3. Copper (requires thermal analysis justification)

Surface finish: Anodized black for optimal heat dissipation
Mounting: Thermal interface material required (TIM pad or paste)

2.2 Connector Specifications
Primary power connector: Amphenol Econoseal series
Signal connectors: TE Connectivity automotive grade
Minimum IP rating: IP67 for exposed connectors

2.3 PCB Requirements
Base material: FR4, minimum 1.6mm thickness
Copper weight: 2oz minimum for power planes
Via-in-pad technology allowed for thermal management

3. Thermal Design
=================

3.1 Thermal Analysis
Maximum junction temperature: 125°C for semiconductors
Ambient temperature rating: 85°C (pending verification)
Thermal derating: Required above 75°C ambient

3.2 Cooling Strategy
Passive cooling preferred
Forced air cooling acceptable if ambient exceeds 70°C
Thermal shutdown: 90°C PCB temperature

4. Quality Requirements
=======================

4.1 Testing Matrix
Temperature cycling: Extended testing at 85°C required
Vibration profile: Automotive specification compliance
EMI/EMC: Pre-compliance testing mandatory

4.2 Reliability Targets
MTBF: 100,000 hours at 85°C operation
Failure rate: <100 FIT at end of life

5. Design Notes
===============

5.1 Thermal Considerations
The 85°C operating temperature specification is currently under engineering review.
Production units should maintain 80°C limit until thermal validation is complete.

5.2 Material Alternatives
Heat sink materials other than Al6061-T6 require engineering approval.
Cost optimization studies are ongoing for alternative aluminum alloys.
