From rfp-a123-v5.txt: 'Thermal cycling: 2000 cycles minimum (increased from v3)' - This further supports the system's ability to handle harsh environmental conditions.\n\n4. The internal-spec-778-v2.txt document even suggests a potential expansion of the operating temperature range to 85°C (though currently maintaining 80°C), which further reinforces the extended temperature range capability.\n\nThe evidence comprehensively supports both key aspects of the claim: reliable operation in harsh automotive environments and extended temperature range capability. The confidence is very high (95) because multiple documents provide consistent and specific evidence directly supporting the claim.",

Similarly, the internal-spec-778-v2.txt document states 'Primary rail: 5V with ±5% tolerance'. The evidence consistently shows that the 5V output has a ±5% tolerance, not the ±4% tolerance stated in the claim. The 3.3V ±3% part of the claim is correctly stated and matches the evidence. Since there is a clear contradiction on the 5V tolerance specification (±5% in evidence vs. ±4% in claim), the verdict must be CONTRADICTED.",

Since there is absolutely no information about undervoltage lockout in the evidence (neither confirming nor contradicting its requirement), the appropriate verdict is NOT_FOUND. The confidence is high (95) because the evidence clearly lists all protection features in dedicated sections (3.2 Protection) in both documents, and undervoltage lockout is definitively absent from these comprehensive lists.",

The most recent document (rfp-a123-v5.txt) does support the claim exactly, stating \"Thermal protection: automatic shutdown at 85°C (reduced from 95°C)\".\n\n2. However, two other documents contradict this claim:\n   - rfp-a123-v3.txt states \"Thermal protection: automatic shutdown at 95°C\" (a higher temperature)\n   - internal-spec-778-v2.txt states \"Thermal shutdown: 90°C PCB temperature\" (a different temperature)\n\nSince we have multiple documents with different specifications, I need to determine which is authoritative. The document rfp-a123-v5.txt appears to be the most recent version (v5 vs v3), and it explicitly notes that the temperature was \"reduced from 95°C\", suggesting this is an updated specification that supersedes the previous 95°C requirement.\n\nTherefore, the claim of \"Thermal protection: automatic shutdown at 85°C\" is SUPPORTED by the most current evidence. The notation \"(reduced from 95°C)\" in the v5 document explains the discrepancy with the older v3 document.",

The evidence clearly lists 'Salt spray testing per ISO 9227 (new requirement)' as part of the Environmental Testing requirements in section 4.1. This is an exact match to the claim, with the only additional information being that this is a 'new requirement'. The evidence directly supports the claim that salt spray testing per ISO 9227 is required. The high confidence score is assigned because the evidence provides an exact match to the claim with no contradictions or ambiguities.",

Both IP65 and IP67 include dust protection at the IP6X level (the '6' in IP65/IP67 indicates complete protection against dust), but they also include water protection (the '5' or '7' part).

The documents reference specific standards (IEC 60068-2-14, ISO 16750-3, CISPR 25, ISO 9227) and provide precise measurement parameters for electrical tests.
