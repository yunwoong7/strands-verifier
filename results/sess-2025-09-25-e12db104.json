From rfp-a123-v5.txt and rfp-a123-v3.txt: Both specify operating temperature ranges of -40°C to 80°C and storage temperature ranges of -55°C to 105°C, which clearly demonstrates 'extended temperature range capability' as claimed.\n\n3. The evidence also shows thermal cycling requirements (2000 cycles minimum in v5, increased from 1000 cycles in v3), further supporting the system's ability to operate reliably in harsh conditions.\n\n4. The internal-spec-778-v2.txt document even suggests a potential expansion of the operating temperature range to -40°C to 85°C (though currently under review), which further supports the extended temperature range capability.\n\nThe evidence comprehensively supports both key aspects of the claim: reliable operation in harsh automotive environments and extended temperature range capability.",

The internal-spec-778-v2.txt also confirms 'Primary rail: 5V with ±5% tolerance' and 'Secondary rail: 3.3V with ±3% tolerance'. The evidence consistently shows that the 5V output has a ±5% tolerance (not ±4% as claimed), while the 3.3V output does match the claimed ±3% tolerance.

The first evidence from rfp-a123-v5.txt states 'Connector type: Amphenol automotive series' without the word 'preferred', indicating it's a requirement rather than a preference. The second evidence from internal-spec-778-v2.txt specifies 'Primary power connector: Amphenol Econoseal series', which is a specific Amphenol automotive series, and mentions 'TE Connectivity automotive grade' for signal connectors. This shows Amphenol is indeed used but with specific series designations and not exclusively for all connector types. The evidence supports that Amphenol automotive series connectors are specified, but doesn't indicate they are merely 'preferred' - they appear to be required for at least some connections. This subtle difference between a preference and a requirement leads to a PARTIAL verdict.",

However, two other documents contradict this claim:\n   - rfp-a123-v3.txt states \"Thermal protection: automatic shutdown at 95°C\" (a higher temperature)\n   - internal-spec-778-v2.txt states \"Thermal shutdown: 90°C PCB temperature\" (a different temperature)\n\nSince we have multiple documents with different specifications, I need to determine which is authoritative. The document rfp-a123-v5.txt appears to be the most recent version (v5 vs v3), and it explicitly notes that the temperature was \"reduced from 95°C\", suggesting this is an updated specification that supersedes the previous 95°C requirement.\n\nTherefore, the claim of \"Thermal protection: automatic shutdown at 85°C\" is SUPPORTED by the most current evidence.

Both IP65 and IP67 include dust protection at the IP6X level (the '6' in IP65/IP67 indicates complete protection against dust), but they also include water protection (the '5' or '7' part).

However, the claim specifically mentions 'detailed reporting' as part of this capability. While the evidence does mention 'Status reporting via CAN bus' and 'Error logging and retrieval' which are forms of reporting, it doesn't explicitly state that the reporting is 'detailed' as claimed. These reporting features are likely related to the self-test capability, but without explicit confirmation that the reporting is detailed, I cannot fully support the claim. The other evidence documents don't provide relevant information about self-test capabilities. Therefore, the claim is partially supported - the self-test capability exists, but the 'detailed' nature of the reporting is not explicitly confirmed.",

The evidence shows detailed test procedures for environmental and electrical testing in multiple documents, including temperature cycling, vibration testing, EMC testing, load regulation, line regulation, and ripple and noise measurements. However, the evidence doesn't explicitly state that these test procedures cover ALL requirements of the system/product. The documents show extensive testing procedures, but without knowing what the complete set of requirements is, we cannot verify if the test procedures are truly comprehensive. The evidence shows test procedures for environmental and electrical aspects, but there might be other requirement categories (functional, safety, reliability, etc.) that aren't mentioned in the provided evidence.
